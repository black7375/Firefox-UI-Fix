** Introduction
  [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Proton][Proton]] is Firefox's new design, starting from Firefox 89. \\
  [[https://design.firefox.com/photon/][Photon]] is the old design of Firefox which was used until version 88.

  Proton's [[#why-proton][overall feel is good]], but there were a few things I [[#why-not-proton][didn't like]] and wanted to improve. \\
  That's why this project was born, and Lepton to denote light theme layer.

  /Disclaimer:/ It works *Firefox 89* and above!!

** WHY Proton?
   I think a lot has improved.

   [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/119773764-a6639e00-beb0-11eb-8023-498b6293c4b2.png]]

   (Proton's design :arrow_up:)

   - Neatly organized menu
   - Icon beautiful enough to remind you of Edge
   - Nice color scheme
   - Satisfied Rounding
   - Modal window & Scrollbar!!

** WHY Not Proton?
   However, there are also many flaws.

   [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/119773812-b5e2e700-beb0-11eb-923c-55ae1a8ca249.png]]

   (Photon's design :arrow_up:)

   - Is it a tab or a button?
   - Where are the menu icons?
   - Icons in ActivityStream are too small
   - Padding gaps are wide
   - :warning: Address bar 3-point menu, screenshot moves to toolbar (can't fix)
