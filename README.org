  (Fixed proton design)

  - *Tab Design*
    - General:
      - Connect with toolbar(Buttons like tabs)
    - Selected:
      - Box Shadow: Highlight the selected tab
    - Unselect:
      - Divide Line: React to hover like chrome
    - Clipped:
      - Cleary Text: Adjusted clipped gradation
    - Sound:
      - Show Favicon: Always show favicon
  - *Activity Stream Design*
    - Search Bar:
      - Focused Shadow: Same as the accent color
    - Icons:
      - Size: Fill it up

** WHY Proton?
   I think a lot has improved.

   (pure proton design)

   - Neatly organized menu
   - Icon beautiful enough to remind you of Edge
   - Nice color scheme
   - Satisfied Rounding
   - Modal window!!

** WHY Not Proton?
   However, there are also many flaws.

   (proton before design)

   - [x] Is it a tab or a button?
   - [] Where are the menu icons?
   - [x] Icons in ActivityStream are too small
   - [] Padding gaps are wide
   - :warning: Address bar 3-point menu, screenshot moves to toolbar (can't fix)

  1. Enable =userChrome.css= Support.
